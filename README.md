# VCV-Rack

My Patches for VCV Rack 

I keep everything created wirh v1 in the patches dir.
Patches after 2023 created using Rack v2.

## Install 

There is no startup script anymore. I use Ubuntu Studio
and Jack is handled by Ubuntu Studio Controls.

## Restore File Times

  sudo apt install git-restore-mtime
  cd .Rack/patches/
  git restore-mtime
